# Bytecoin Web Wallet

Under work! Soon this will be updated. 

If you want to run the integration test _Bytecoin RPC Wallet_ must be running. See more at [willianantunes/bytecoin-rpc-wallet](https://hub.docker.com/r/willianantunes/bytecoin-rpc-wallet/).

UPDATE: Now you can run IT just typing the following command: `mvn integration-test`
